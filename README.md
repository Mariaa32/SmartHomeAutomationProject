# SmartHomeAutomationProject
Project Title:
Smart Home Automation Using ATmega32, LCD, Temperature Sensor, LDR Sensor, Flame Sensor
and Motor Control
This project is written with Drivers for: LCD, LDR, LED, LM35 Sensor, Flame Sensor, Motor, GPIO, Buzzer, PWM, ADC, STD Types.

Objective:
To design and implement a smart home system that automates the control of lighting and fan
speed based on environmental conditions. The project uses an ATmega32 microcontroller, LM35
temperature sensor, LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), Flame sensor, and a PWM-controlled
motor. An LCD provides real-time display, and an H-bridge circuit controls the fan motor.
Additionally, LEDs indicate varying light intensity levels.

Project Overview:
This project involves developing a smart home system that adjusts lighting, fan speed, and safety
alerts based on environmental conditions:
1. Lighting Control: The LDR detects ambient light intensity and controls three LEDs to
indicate different levels of light.
2. Fan Speed Control: The LM35 temperature sensor adjusts the fan speed proportionally to
the room temperature.
3. Fire Detection: A flame sensor detects fire, triggers an alarm, and displays a critical alert
on the LCD.
4. LCD Display: Shows real-time temperature readings, fan status, light intensity, and alerts.
